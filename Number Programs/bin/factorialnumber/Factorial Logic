Create a first class
Create a method
Declare a new variable inside a for loop and store the factorial of a number
initialize both variable is 1(for (int i=1;i<n;i++))
Using a for loop calculate a factorial number 
fact=fact*i;
Then Print factorial numbers from 1 to n.
Again create a second class
Taking a user input from scanner class
Reading a character and storing in a int type variable
Using first name calling a method
Then get the output
Output:
   n=5!
  5*4*3*2*1 = 120

create a first class
Create a method and pass the values(a,b)then,
Use if condition,if(b!=0) then,
initialize a integer type variable r = a%b
                 a=b
                 b=remainder
Then print the a value 
Again create a second class
Taking a user input from scanner class
Reading a character and storing in a integer type variable
Using first name calling a method
Then get the output
Output:
  a=4
  b=8
  GCD means greatest common divisor so here output is 4
